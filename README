So far.....

I have implemented the action and sensor model, and the main class to repeatedly call them.

Both models are currently perfect ones, i.e. they assume there is no error in the sensor or the robot's movement - This is still to do.

The probabilities are not yet set correctly, I just increase/decrease the probability by a 
certain value and then redistribute the entire map at the end - I will be doing this next week.

I don't yet have a way to test the code, as I don't have the map, however the code compiles - bug fixing will also be in the following weeks.

I have also copied and pasted George's map code in order to use some of his methods.
