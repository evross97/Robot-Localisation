#Robot Localisation

- Mini java project as part of a larger team project to enable a lego NXT robot to navigate a maze
- This code allows robot to determine where it is currently located, based on a previously given map

The map file was written by a team mate but is necessary to perform the localisation
There are two type of models that are used to calculate the current position of the robot on the map, an action model and a sensor model
The action model calculates the probability that the robot is in a current position X, given it's previous position Y, and the move that the robot just took
The sensor model calculates the probability that the robot is in a current position X, given the objects and walls that the robot can sense around it
The localiser uses both models whenever it needs to localise - it will create a map of probabilities for each position and then select the point with the highest probability to be the assumed position of the robot
